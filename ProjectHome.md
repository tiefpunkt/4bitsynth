# Introduction #
4bitsynth is a MIDI-controlled digital synthesizer that uses the Atmel AVR ATMega48. Inspired by the NES, the sound is 4-bit. The digital output is put through an R-2R resistor ladder to get the analog waveform.

## Demos ##
[Listen to ogg/mp3 demos of the synths in action](http://code.google.com/p/4bitsynth/wiki/Demos)
